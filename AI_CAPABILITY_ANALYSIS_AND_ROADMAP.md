# üéØ AI Companion & Domain Insights Roadmap

**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Current Model:** `ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:personal:yoga-recovery:Bx9M1Xes`  
**Total Training Examples:** 247 examples across 8 datasets

## üéØ **CORE VISION: COMPANION WITH DOMAIN INSIGHTS**

### **The Sweet Spot We're Targeting:**
- **Not too generic:** "Try gentle stretching" (adds no value)
- **Not too technical:** Complex biomechanical assessments
- **Just right:** Specific, helpful insights that guide users toward solutions

### **Example of Perfect Balance:**
‚ùå **Too Generic:** "Try gentle stretching"  
‚ùå **Too Technical:** "This appears to be patellofemoral pain syndrome requiring specific biomechanical assessment"  
‚úÖ **Just Right:** "Knee pain can be really frustrating. It sounds like it might be related to tight quadriceps or weak glutes. Try some gentle quad stretches and glute bridges - these often help with knee discomfort. How does that feel?"

## üéØ **SIMPLIFIED ROADMAP: COMPANION WITH INSIGHTS**

### **Phase 1: Enhance Domain Insights (Weeks 1-2)**

#### **Priority 1: Expand Injury Support (37 ‚Üí 50 examples)**
- **Focus:** Specific enough to be helpful, supportive enough to be encouraging
- **Approach:** "This sounds like X, try Y, see how it feels"
- **Examples:**
  - "Knee pain often relates to tight quads - try gentle quad stretches"
  - "Shoulder tightness usually responds well to doorway stretches"
  - "Lower back discomfort often improves with gentle cat-cow movements"
- **Expected Impact:** +15-20% improvement in injury support

#### **Priority 2: Expand Yoga-Mobility Support (19 ‚Üí 40 examples)**
- **Focus:** Specific poses that target specific issues
- **Approach:** "Try this pose, it targets those tight hip flexors"
- **Examples:**
  - "Pigeon pose specifically targets tight hip flexors"
  - "Downward dog helps with shoulder and hamstring tightness"
  - "Child's pose is great for lower back relief"
- **Expected Impact:** +15-20% improvement in mobility guidance

#### **Priority 3: Enhance Action-Oriented Responses (20 ‚Üí 40 examples)**
- **Focus:** Less generic advice, more specific actionable suggestions
- **Approach:** "Try this specific approach, it often helps"
- **Examples:**
  - "Start with 5 minutes of gentle walking to warm up"
  - "Try foam rolling your quads for 2-3 minutes"
  - "Focus on deep breathing during stretches"
- **Expected Impact:** +20-25% improvement in actionability

### **Phase 2: Refine Companion Skills (Weeks 3-4)**

#### **Priority 4: Enhance Specificity Reinforcement (20 ‚Üí 40 examples)**
- **Focus:** Force specific terminology while maintaining companion tone
- **Approach:** Balance domain knowledge with supportive language
- **Expected Impact:** +20-25% improvement in specificity

#### **Priority 5: Optimize Memory Integration (27 examples)**
- **Focus:** Better integration of domain insights with memory
- **Approach:** "Remember when we talked about your knee? Try that quad stretch again"
- **Expected Impact:** +10-15% improvement in personalized guidance
